B is entitled\nto receive from A, by way of compensation, the difference between the\ncontract price of the cloth and its market price at the time of delivery, but not\nthe profits which he expected to obtain by making caps, nor the expenses\nwhich he has been put to in making preparation for the manufacture.\n(r)        A, a ship-owner, contracts with B to convey him from l[Karachi] to Sydney in\nA’s ship, sailing on the first of January, and B pays to A, by way of deposit,\none-half of his passage-money. The ship does not sail on the first of January,\nand B, after being, in consequence, detained in l[Karachi] for some time, and\nthereby put to some expense, proceeds to Sydney in another vessel, and, in\nconsequence, arriving too late in Sydney, loses a sum of money. A is liable to\nrepay to B his deposit, with interest, and the expense to which he is put by his\ndetention in 1[Karachi] and the excess, if any, of the passage-money paid for\nthe second ship over that agreed upon for the first, but not the sum of money\nwhich B lost by, arrivaing in Sydney too late."
