sub­\nsection (1) of section 9, and in sub­section (3) of section 9.\n(3) The Commission shall, to the extent possible, examine the accuracy and adequacy of the\nevidence provided in an application to determine whether it is compliant with the requirements of\nsub­section (2) and in order to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify initiation of an\ninvestigation.\n(4) An investigation may be initiated by the Commission in order to determine whether or not the\nalleged subsidies are specific in accordance with the principles set out in section 5.\n(5) An investigation may also be initiated by the Commission in respect of subsidies which are\nnon­countervailable in accordance with the provisions of section 6 in order to determine whether or\nnot the conditions set

application\nhas been made by or on behalf of domestic industry.\n(9) An application shall be considered to have been made by or on behalf of domestic industry if\nit is supported by those domestic producers whose collective output constitutes more than fifty\npercent of the total production of a like product produced by that portion of domestic industry\nexpressing either support for or opposition to the application:\nProvided that no investigation shall be initiated by the Commission when domestic producers\nexpressly supporting an application account for less than twenty­five percent of the total production\nof a like product produced by domestic industry.\n(10) The Commission shall, as soon as possible after receipt of a properly documented application\nin accordance with the requirements of section 11, and in any event before initiation of an\ninvestigation, give notice to an exporting country, which shall be invited for consultations with the\naim of clarifying the situation as to matters referred to in sub­section (2) and arriving at a mutually\nagreed solution.\n(11) The Commission may, suo moto, initiate an investigation without having received a

evidence both of subsidy and of injury shall be considered simultaneously by the\nCommission in the decision on whether or not to initiate an investigation and an\napplication shall be rejected where there is insufficient evidence of either countervailable subsidies or\nof injury to justify initiation of an investigation:\nProvided that an investigation shall not be initiated against countries whose imports represent a\nmarket share of below one per cent unless such countries collectively account for three per cent or\nmore of domestic consumption.\n(13) An application may be withdrawn by an applicant prior to initiation of an investigation by\nthe Commission, in which case it shall, subject to the provisions of sub­section (1) of section 15, be\ndeemed not to have been made:\nProvided that upon withdrawal of an application any fee paid by an applicant pursuant to sub­\nsection (2) shall stand forfeited in favour of the Commission.\n(14) Where, after consultation with an exporting country as provided for in sub­section (10), the\nCommission is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to justify initiating an investigation, the\nCommission shall give notice of such decision by means of a public notice of initiation of an\ninvestigation, and the initiation of an investigation shall be effective on the date on which such notice\nis published.\n(15) Where the Commission does not consider it appropriate to initiate an investigation it shall\ninform an applicant of its decision.\n(16) The public notice of initiation of an investigation referred to in sub­section (14) shall\nannounce initiation of an investigation, indicate the product and countries concerned, give a summary\nof the information received, provide that all relevant information is to be communicated to the\nCommission, state the periods within which any interested party may make itself known, present its\nviews in writing and submit information if such views and information are to be taken into account\nduring the investigation and shall also state the period within which interested parties may apply to be\nheard by the Commission in accordance with sub­section (4) of section 12.\n(17) The Commission shall advise any exporters, importers and any association of importers or\nexporters known to it to be concerned, as well as an exporting country and an applicant, of initiation\nof an investigation and, subject to the requirements of section 29, provide the full text of an\napplication to the known exporters and to the authorities of an exporting country, and make it\navailable upon request to other interested parties involved:\nProvided that, where the Commission determines that the number of exporters involved is\nparticularly high, the full text of a written complaint may
