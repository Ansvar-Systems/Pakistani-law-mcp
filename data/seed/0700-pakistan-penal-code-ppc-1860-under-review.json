It is sufficient if he engages\nin the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.\nIllustration\nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then\nexplains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without\nmentioning A’s name.

Here, as soon as A has severed\nthe tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.\n(b)     A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z’s dog to follow it. Here,\nif A's intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z’s possession without Z’s\nconsent, A has committed theft as soon as Z’s dog has begun to follow A.\n(c)     A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain\ndirection, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the\nbullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.\n(d)     A being Z’s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z’s plate, dishonestly\nruns away with the plate, without Z’s consent. A has committed theft.\n(e)     Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z\nshall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was\nnot in Z’s possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z’s possession and\nA has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of\ntrust.\n(f)     A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the\nring is in Z’s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.\n(g)     A finds a ring lying on the high-road, not in the possession of any person. A, by\ntaking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation\nof property.\n(h)     A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z’s house. Not venturing to\nmisappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides\nthe ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z,\nwith the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when\nthe loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.\n(i)     A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A,\nnot owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain\nthe watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of\nZ’s hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal\ntrespass and assault, has not committed theft, in as much as what he did was not\ndone dishonestly.\n(j)     If A owns money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully\nas a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z’s possession, with the\nintention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits\ntheft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.\n(k)     Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z’s possession without\nZ's consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, be commits theft,\nthough the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.\n(l)     A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z’s possession with out Z’s consent,\nwith the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for\nits restoration. Here A takes dishonestly ; A has therefore committed theft.\n(m)     A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes in to Z’s library in Z’s absence, and\ntakes away a book without Z’s express consent for the purpose merely of\nreading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable than A may\nhave conceived that he had Z’s implied consent to use Z’s book. If this was A's\nimpression, A has not committed theft.\n(n)     A asks charity from Z’s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A\nknows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that\nZ’s wife is authorized to give away alms. If this was A’s impression, A has not\ncommitted theft.\n(o)     A is the paramour of Z’s wife. She gives A valuable property, which A knows\nto belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has not authority\nfrom Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.\n(p)     A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A’s own property, takes\nthat property out of B’s possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he\ndoes not commit theft."

A, in order to defraud\nB, adds a cipher to the 10,000 and makes the sum 1,00,000, intending that it may\nbe believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.\n(b)     A, without Z’s authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a\nconveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B\nand thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery.\n(c)     A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any\nsum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by\ninserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery.\n(d)    A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting\nthe sum payable and authorizes B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not\nexceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B\nfraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees.\nB commits forgery.\n(e)    A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B’s authority,\nintending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up\nthe bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the\nbanker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to\ndiscount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.\n(f)    Z’s will contains these words­\"I direct that all my remaining property be equally\ndivided between A, B and C.\" A dishonestly scratches out B’s name, intending\nthat it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has\ncommitted forgery.\n(g)    A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his\norder by writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” and signing the\nendorsement. B dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order” and thereby\nconverts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery.\n(h)    A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his\nestate executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier\nthan the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had\nconveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery.\n(i)    Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the\nlegatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will\naccording to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed\nforgery.\n(j)    A writes a letter and signs it with B’s name without B's authority, certifying that\nA is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen\nmisfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other\npersons. Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with\nproperty. A has committed forgery.\n(k)    A without B’s authority writes a letter and signs it in B’s name certifying to A’s\ncharacter, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed\nforgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and\nthereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service.\nExplanation 1.__ A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery.\nIllustrations\n(a)    A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed\nthat the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed\nforgery.\n(b)     A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z’s name, in\norder that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B\nupon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty\nof forgery ; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant\nto A’s intention, B is also guilty of forgery.\n(c)     A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the\nsame name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be\nbelieved that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable, here\nA has committed forgery.\n(d)     A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B after the\nseizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate to Z at a\nnominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the\nseizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease\nwas granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name,\ncommits forgery by antedating it.\n(e)     A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A’s benefit,\nand with intent to defraud his creditors ; and in order to give a colour to the\ntransaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value\nreceived, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been\nmade before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under\nthe first head of the definition.\nExplanation 2.__ The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending\nit to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person,\nintending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his life time, may amount to\nforgery.\nIllustration\nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the\nname of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it.
